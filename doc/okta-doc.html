      <li>Audio Matrix  Audio matrix is implemented using mtx~ family of objects (bundled  with pdextended) and [#many tgl] for UI. The Matrix works as  follows: inputs are mapped horizontally, outputs vertically so the  followig arrangements gives a direct channel mapping  (i.e. input1->outpu1, input2->output2 etc.):</li>
