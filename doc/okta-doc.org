* Overview
* Running
** Installation requirements
   - pdextended version 0.42.5 (not tested with any other version)
   - oktadb external (Geoffrey Jones)
     It's actually included in the package in source form
   - gridflow library (http://gridflow.ca)
     Very useful for the audio matrix, notably the [#many] object and translating matrices to lists etc.
   - rjlib (https://github.com/rjdj/rjlib)

** Looping player
** EQ
** Audio Matrix
   Audio matrix is implemented using mtx~ family of objects (bundled
   with pdextended) and [#many tgl] for UI. The Matrix works as
   follows: inputs are mapped horizontally, outputs vertically so the
   followig arrangements gives a direct channel mapping
   (i.e. input1->outpu1, input2->output2 etc.):

   |      | in1 | in2 | in3 | in4 |
   | out1 | x   |     |     |     |
   | out2 |     | x   |     |     |
   | out3 |     |     | x   |     |
   | out4 |     |     |     | x   |
